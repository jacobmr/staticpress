┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  Ready to Publish?              │
│  Your post will be visible      │
│                                 │
│  Title: My First Post           │
│                                 │

## 🎨 Design Principles Applied

4. **Subtle Polish**: Animations and transitions add delight without distraction
5. **Error Prevention**: Confirmation prevents accidental actions
